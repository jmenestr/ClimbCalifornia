#Climb California 

__Climb California is a rich web application built with Ruby on Rails and React.js_

Users can create climbing trips, search for trips based on features and location, and follow users with similiar interests. 

## Feature Highlights


### Complex user search over multiple tables 
 
  * Users can search for other users based on what kind of activitiy tags that other user has created or liked

<pre>

  # Joins users table on both adventures table and adventure_likes table to grab user's created and liked adventures 
  # Next joins on adventure_activities and filters based on an IN clause of activity ids which are passed in from an 
  AJAX request
  
   users = users.joins("LEFT OUTER JOIN adventures ON adventures.user_id = users.id")
      .joins("LEFT OUTER JOIN adventure_likes ON adventure_likes.user_id = users.id")
      .joins("JOIN adventure_activities ON (adventure_activities.adventure_id = adventure_likes.adventure_id OR adventure_activities.adventure_id = adventures.id)")
      .where("adventure_activities.activity_id": activities)
      .group("users.id")
</pre>

### User Feed 
  * Lists adventures that I think the user may like based on who the user is following, what the user has liked, and the associated activity tags with those trips. It excludes the user's own trips. 

<pre>
    # Grabs activity_ids associated with current user's created adventures
    user_activitiy_ids = 
    AdventureActivity.joins(:adventure)
    .where("adventures.user_id = ?", current_user.id)
    .pluck(:activity_id)

    # Grabs user_ids of all people the Current User is following 
    following_user_ids = current_user.following.pluck(:id).uniq

    # In summary, the following query grabs joins adventures to all likes, follows, and adventure_activities and keeps the following to display: 
    # 1. Any adventures the current user likes 
    # 2. Any adventures that have been liked or created by people the current user follows 
    # 3. Any adventures that are tagged with activities in user_activity_ids

    Adventure.joins("LEFT OUTER JOIN adventure_likes ON adventure_likes.adventure_id = adventures.id")
    .joins("LEFT OUTER JOIN follows ON follows.followee_id = adventures.user_id")
    .joins("LEFT OUTER JOIN adventure_activities ON adventure_activities.adventure_id = adventure.id")
    .where("(adventure_likes.user_id = :id OR 
     adventure_likes.user_id IN :following_ids OR 
     follows.follower_id = :id OR  
     adventure_activities.activity_id IN :activity_ids) 
     AND adventures.user_id != :id",
      id: current_user.id, following_ids: following_user_ids, activity_ids: user_activity_ids)
    .group("adventures.id")
    
</pre>

### Jbuilder serilization and chaching  

* Json responses are built using JBuilder to structure json response in logical way for front end use 
* User partials for modular jbuilder templates of discrete components 
* User jbuilder cache to prevent reloading of templates unless data has changed. This speeds up load times  ( ~ 3x when after initial loading

<pre>
  # Example for User Feed template 

  json.cache! @feed do 
  json.feed do 
    json.partial! partial: 'api/adventures/index_adventure', collection: @feed, as: :adventure, locals: { location: @current_local}   
  end
  json.firstPage @first_last_pages[:firstPage]
  json.lastPage @first_last_pages[:lastPage]
end

</pre> 

### Implements location searching with Filter Parameter Store and React search component

* Filter Component holds current filters and resonds to update with API request for new data

<pre>
  getInitialState: function() {
      return { 
        filters: FilterParamsStore.allParams(),
        page: FilterParamsStore.page(),
        selectedMarker: undefined }
    },

    // State holds current filters and adds change listener on Filter Store to keep updated 
    // list of filters
    componentDidMount: function() {
      this.autocomplete =  React.findDOMNode(this.refs.maps_autocomplete);
      FilterParamsStore.addFilterChangeEventListener(this._handleChange);
      this.setState({ filters: FilterParamsStore.allParams() });
    },

    // Upon new filter parameters, callback retrieves current filters and issues new API request for
    // updated data
    _handleChange: function() {
      var currentFilters = FilterParamsStore.allParams();
      var page = FilterParamsStore.page();
      ApiUtils.fetchAllAdventures(currentFilters, page);
      this.setState( { filters: currentFilters, page: page });
    }
</pre>

 * Nested inside of Filter is Index which listens for new data from backend and updates accordingly 

<pre>
  // Adventure Index then listens for return of updated adventures and refreshes React component 
  // with new state
  root.AdventureIndex = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function() {
      return { 
        adventures: AdventureStore.all(),
        ...
         }
    },

    ...

    _handleChange: function() {
      this.setState( { 
        adventures: AdventureStore.all(),
        ... })
    }
</pre>


## TODOS 
* Implement user follows/following for the user profile so user can see who they are following and who's following them 
* Implmenet notification feautre based on Web Sockets. Have users see when a new user follows them or when another likes their adventures 
* Implmement a user messaging feature where users online at the same time can chat with each other.
